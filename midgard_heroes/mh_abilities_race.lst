When they do act, it’s with the same intense ferocity as any of their kin. Stone dragonkin grow scales of gray, black, or rarely, white. Their crests or frills are purple or white. Like the stolid dragons that are their forebears, stone dragonkin are the most resilient of their ilk.

Edjet make up a large segment of dragonkin presence in the Mharoti armies, serving as heavy infantry and shock troops. Despite the dragonkin’s usual slow speed, edjet have fast reflexes and keen aim.

Constructed Body	KEY:Gearforged ~ Constructed Body			SORTKEY:1_Race	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gearforged Trait.Base Gearforged Trait.SpecialQuality.Race Trait		DESC:Your consciousness and soul reside within a soul gem to animate your mechanical body. As such, you are a living creature with some of the benefits and drawbacks of a construct. • You cannot eat, drink, or breathe. You can’t drink potions or gain benefits that come from drinking, eating, or inhaling vapors. • You do not naturally sleep. • During a rest, you must perform maintenance on your gears, springs, and joints, following the normal rules governing rest and activity. While performing this maintenance, you are aware of your surroundings but you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks. If you go longer than 24 hours without performing maintenance (you don’t take a long rest), you gain one level of exhaustion. All exhaustion gained this way disappears after your next long rest. • You can’t be stabilized when dying with a Wisdom (Medicine) check or spare the dying. Instead, a successful DC 10 Intelligence check or a mending cantrip is needed. • You regain only one-half the usual number of hit points from spells or magical effects with the words cure, heal, or healing in their titles.

Solid Construction	KEY:Gearforged ~ Constructed Body			SORTKEY:1_Race	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Gearforged Trait.Base Gearforged Trait.SpecialQuality.Race Trait		DESC:If you are killed but your soul gem and memory gears are still intact, you can be restored to life if your body is repaired and soulforging is cast on it again. Because the body already exists, the cost of the ritual is just 500 gp, plus the cost of repairing the body (DM’s discretion, typically 1d4 x 50 gp). If your body was destroyed but your soul gem and memory tapes are intact, they can be implanted into a new body at the standard cost (10,000 gp). The only other magic capable of bringing you back from the dead is a wish spell, which restores you fully.				SOURCEPAGE:p.9
